## Introduction 🌟
This project, **IntelliDrive**, implements advanced lane and vehicle detection using the state-of-the-art YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once, version 8) model. The primary goal is to identify vehicles and lane boundaries in video data, essential for autonomous driving applications. The YOLOv8 model, with its pretrained weights, enables high accuracy and computational efficiency, making it suitable for real-time perception tasks.

## Methodology 🔬

### 1. **Lane Detection** 🛣️
- **Edge Detection**: Applied Canny edge detection to identify edges in the video frame. ✂️
- **Region of Interest (ROI)**: Masked the area of interest to focus on lanes. 🎯
- **Line Fitting**: Hough Line Transformation and polynomial fitting were used to detect left and right lane boundaries. 📊
- **Visualization**: Created a filled polygon between lane lines for better visualization. 🖌️

### 2. **Vehicle Detection** 🏎️
- **YOLOv8 Model**: Leveraged pretrained YOLOv8 weights to detect vehicles. 🧑‍💻
- **Bounding Boxes**: Drew bounding boxes around detected vehicles. 🔲
- **Classification**: Focused on detecting cars with confidence scores ≥ 0.5. ✅

### 3. **Distance Estimation** 📏
- **Bounding Box Dimensions**: Used box size to estimate vehicle distance. 📐
- **Basic Calculation**: Assumed focal length and known dimensions for approximate distance calculation. 🔢

### 4. **Integration** 🌐
- Combined lane detection and vehicle detection outputs for simultaneous visualization in real time. ⚡
- Enabled autonomous driving features like lane-keeping and collision avoidance. 🏎️
